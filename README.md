## CI / Release

- **CI** runs via the shared [`argus-ci`](https://github.com/smk762/argus-ci) reusable workflow.
- **Release** publishes to PyPI (OIDC trusted publishing) and GHCR on `v*` tags.
- Versioning is derived from git tags via `hatch-vcs` — tag `vX.Y.Z` to cut a release.

This repo was scaffolded from [`argus-pkg-template`](https://github.com/smk762/argus-pkg-template).
Run `copier update` to pull template changes (CI, release, tooling).
